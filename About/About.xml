--- Original Description ---
Twi'lek race by Xen

Twi'leks (From the Star Wars universe) are known for their grace, beauty, and powers of seduction.

They have a high chance to appear with 'beautiful' trait

They have a slight bonus to social interactions, in exchange for a slightly increased appetite
(I wanted to do something else for a 'negative' since I did something similar for my Xenn race, but this is actually canon apparently - offworld twi'leks never turn down food, and obesity is considered by many a status symbol)

I may give them 4 stomachs later (which is also canon) - but I almost feel like that would be a bit too unbalancing - maybe 2.

I'll have to gather opinions on that.
